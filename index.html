            Hello, my name is Nakell Williams. I am from Greenville, South Carolina. I was raised in a 
            small part of Greenville called Foutain Inn, where I spend majority of my life. During my time 
            growing up, I attended Hillcrest High School where I played varsity fooball, track, and basketball 
            while maintaining a 3.700 GPA. After graduation, I decided to continue my education at the University 
            of South Carolina.
        </p>

            During my time at the University of South Carolina, I majored in Integrated Information
            Technology (iIT). I spend four years at the University of South Carolina, while graduating
            with a 3.78 GPA and pledging the great fraternity on the planet, Kappa Alpha Psi. I also recieved
            an job offer for a IT rotation program for 18 months at Lowe's corporate office, which i accepted.
            Within Lowe's I have had 2 role , business analyst and technical analyst both within the digital
            department. I have been promoted two within two years, and learned alot. I plan on continuing
            this journey.
