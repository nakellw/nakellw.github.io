        Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. 
        Eliptical talk. Hammock talk come soon. Life is what you make it, 
        so let’s make it. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower,
        dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. Lion! 
        In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it.
        Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. Look at the sunset, 
        life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it.
